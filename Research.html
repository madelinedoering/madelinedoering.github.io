  I have studied shifts of finite type (SFTs), specifically the sets of periodic points. I also participate in the Dynamical Systems seminar where we have discussed ergodic theory, entropy, and multidimensional shift spaces.
  <!-- Maddie does lots of great things that I know very little about except that it is contained within the complement of what I do in dynamical systems. Also there is some graph theory. She presents regularly in a seminar on [ergodic theory?], because she is awesome.-->

During my Master's degree in Business Analytics, I worked with <a href="https://www.amprobotics.com" target="_blank">AMP Robotics</a> to complete my capstone project for which I won the Distinguished Capstone Award. This work looked at using system data to predict machine malfunctions in their recycling robot, as well as potential data monetization.</p>
<p>
During my undergraduate degree, I wrote honors theses in symbolic dynamics (mathematics) and microfinance (economics). My mathematics thesis was the basis for the "A characterization of the sets of periods within shifts of finite type" with Ronnie Pavlov. My economics thesis, "Microfinance in Ecuador - A Review," was completed onsite with a summer research grant. This work was presented at the <a href="https://www.du.edu/uap/symposium/" target="_blank">2016 DU Undergraduate Research Symposium</a> .
</p>
  <!-- During her Master's degree, Maddie did even more amazing things. More than I can possibly fathom. </p>
  <p> This work was presented at: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/" target="_blank"> The aforementioned [ergodic theory] seminar, 2018 </a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/wse/river_symposiums/2016/index.html" target="_blank"> probably another time too, idk </a> </li>
</ol>
<p> The abstract for this thesis can be found <a href="https://digitalcommons.bucknell.edu/honors_theses/405/" target="_blank">here</a>. I think there is already a paper. </p>

<h2> Publications </h2>
<p> Doering, M. The aforementioned paper. Journal of Math. </p> -->
