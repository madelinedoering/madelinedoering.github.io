<h3 id="FemmeinSTEM">Femme in STEM</h3>    
      <p> Femme in STEM is a brainchild I developed with four partners while at the University of Denver. Using multiple grants of leadership and honors programs, 
      we developed our own free program to empower girls ages 9-13 in STEM from across the Front Range of Colorado. Through three events and with over 100 participants,
      we crafted a one-day event that exposed girls to a breadth of specialized STEM topics, let them choose one to dive deeply into, 
      and developed their confidence with our unique science fair system. Here is a sample of our outreach sessions:</p>

<h3 id="MathOutreach">Math Outreach</h3>
    <p> Since the success of Femme in STEM I've developed more mathematics curriculum that exposes participants to female role models, proves they can solve 
      "advanced" topics," and teaches through storytelling.</p>

<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
<p> 
I greatly enjoy teaching mathematics and developing new instructional skills. I've completed several professional development opportunities, including but not limited to: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Instructional Skills Workshop</b>, a comprehensive instructor development workshop designed to enhance the teaching effectiveness of both new and experienced instructors. May 2018. </li>
  <li> <b>Facilitator Development Workshop</b>, a workshop designed to train facilitators for the ISW so more locations/departments can have their own ISW. December 2018.</li>
  <li> <b>Math 599</b>, a graduate course on teaching mathematics at the undergraduate level. Winter 2018 Term 2.</li>
</ol>
  <!-- Maddie is an awesome teacher. I know this because she has done all the things that UBC has for instructor development, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>  Math 599, a course on teaching mathematics at the undergraduate level. </li>
  <li> Instructional Skills Workshop, a workshop for improving your instructional skills. </li>
  <li> Facilitator Development Workshop, a workshop for learning how to facilitate an Instructional Skills Workshop. </li>
  <li> Clickers Workshop, a workshop for learning how to effectively use iClickers in class. </li>
  <li> an education theory (?) seminar/thing with Matt, unsure of the details of this one, but I'm like 95% sure it happened. </li>
