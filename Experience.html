<h1>Madeline Doering</h1>    
    <p> I'm currently a Script Editor for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/crashcourse" target="_blank">Crash Course</a>, the educational YouTube channel with over 11 million subscribers. As editor I project manage small teams of contractors, craft overall series story-arcs/goals/learning objectives, develop scripts, and help guide current and future channel operations.</p> 
    <p>Previously I used data to tell stories and facilitated learning in a variety of ways, such as teaching and studying mathematics at <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca" target="_blank">The University of British Columbia</a>, bringing together art and ideas as a Project Assistant for the <a href="https://www.biennialoftheamericas.org" target="_blank">Biennial of the Americas</a>, or conducting research projects like reviewing microfinance in Ecuador. </p> 
    <p>Here's an overview of my (sometimes eclectic) skills, work, and interests. Resume available upon request.</p>

    <h4 id="STEM">Women in STEM Outreach</h4>  
    <p>I've written curriculum focused on empowering women and inspiring curiosity in STEM for many years and a variety of outlets. Below is information 
      on the programs where I've presented. More information on specific sessions can be found under <a href="/STEMpowered">STEM-Powered Outreach</a>. </p>

<h3 id="ResearchProjects">Research Projects</h3>
    <p> Here's a selection of the research projects I've conducted spanning mathematics, data analytics, and economics.</p>
    <h4 id="symbolic-dynamics">Symbolic Dynamics</h4>
<p> 
  I studied the intersection of Dynamical Systems and Graph Theory: Symbolic Dynamics. 
  At the University of Denver I worked with <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~rpavlov/" target="_blank">Ronnie Pavlov</a> before doing post-grad work with <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/Brian Marcus" target="_blank">Brian Marcus</a> at the University of British Columbia. 
  Through both I explored shifts of finite type (SFTs) and sofic shifts, specifically the sets of periodic points that can possibly appear. 
  Doing this required constructing directed graphs and exploring all their possible configurations. The first iteration of this work was published in INVOLVE: A Journal of Mathematics.
  <!-- Maddie does lots of great things that I know very little about except that it is contained within the complement of what I do in dynamical systems. Also there is some graph theory. She presents regularly in a seminar on [ergodic theory?], because she is awesome.-->
</p>
  <h5
  id="publications">Publications</h5>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li> M.Doering and R. Pavlov. A characterization of the sets of periods within shifts of finite type. INVOLVE, 12:2 (2019).
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<h4 id="data-analytics">Data Analytics | AMP Robotics</h4>
<p> 
During my Master's degree in Business Analytics, I worked with <a href="https://www.amprobotics.com" target="_blank">AMP Robotics</a> to complete my capstone project for which I won the Distinguished Capstone Award. This work looked at using system data to predict machine malfunctions in their recycling robot, as well as potential data monetization.</p>

<h4 id="Microfinance">Microfinance in Ecuador</h4>  
  <p>
During my undergraduate degree, I wrote honors theses in symbolic dynamics (mathematics) and microfinance (economics). My mathematics thesis was the basis for the "A characterization of the sets of periods within shifts of finite type" with Ronnie Pavlov. My economics thesis, "Microfinance in Ecuador - A Review," was completed onsite with a summer research grant. This work was presented at the <a href="https://www.du.edu/uap/symposium/" target="_blank">2016 DU Undergraduate Research Symposium</a> .
</p>
  <!-- During her Master's degree, Maddie did even more amazing things. More than I can possibly fathom. </p>
  <p> This work was presented at: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/" target="_blank"> The aforementioned [ergodic theory] seminar, 2018 </a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/wse/river_symposiums/2016/index.html" target="_blank"> probably another time too, idk </a> </li>
</ol>
<p> The abstract for this thesis can be found <a href="https://digitalcommons.bucknell.edu/honors_theses/405/" target="_blank">here</a>. I think there is already a paper. </p>-->

<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
<p> 
I greatly enjoy teaching mathematics and developing new instructional skills. I've completed several professional development opportunities, including but not limited to: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Instructional Skills Workshop</b>, a comprehensive instructor development workshop designed to enhance the teaching effectiveness of both new and experienced instructors. May 2018. </li>
  <li> <b>Facilitator Development Workshop</b>, a workshop designed to train facilitators for the ISW so more locations/departments can have their own ISW. December 2018.</li>
  <li> <b>Math 599</b>, a graduate course on teaching mathematics at the undergraduate level. Winter 2018 Term 2.</li>
</ol>
  <!-- Maddie is an awesome teacher. I know this because she has done all the things that UBC has for instructor development, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>  Math 599, a course on teaching mathematics at the undergraduate level. </li>
  <li> Instructional Skills Workshop, a workshop for improving your instructional skills. </li>
  <li> Facilitator Development Workshop, a workshop for learning how to facilitate an Instructional Skills Workshop. </li>
  <li> Clickers Workshop, a workshop for learning how to effectively use iClickers in class. </li>
  <li> an education theory (?) seminar/thing with Matt, unsure of the details of this one, but I'm like 95% sure it happened. </li>
</ol> -->
