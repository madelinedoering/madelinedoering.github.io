<h3 id="bio">About</h3>

<p>I'm a data enthusiast and math-communicator working to put the femme in STEM and empower people through learning. Currently I'm a Script Editor at <a href="https://complexly.com" target="_blank">Complexly</a> where I work on the educational YouTube channel  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse" target="_blank">Crash Course</a>. Here is a sample of my work as writer and editor.
<p>
Previously I studied data analytics and warehousing, dynamical systems, and the microfinance industry in Ecuador. When I’m not thinking about math or teaching, I’m reading, baking, looking for whales, or sampling new cheeses. Thanks for stopping by. 
</p>
  <!-- Maddie is the coolest cat in the Math department. She's doing her PhD in symbolic dynamics at The University of British Columbia, working with <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/" target="_blank">Brian Marcus</a>. Previously, she worked with <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~rpavlov/" target="_blank">Ronnie Pavlov</a> at the University of Denver, who is very good at trivia and probably also math. -->
  




<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
<p> 
I greatly enjoy teaching mathematics and developing new instructional skills. I've completed several professional development opportunities, including but not limited to: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Instructional Skills Workshop</b>, a comprehensive instructor development workshop designed to enhance the teaching effectiveness of both new and experienced instructors. May 2018. </li>
  <li> <b>Facilitator Development Workshop</b>, a workshop designed to train facilitators for the ISW so more locations/departments can have their own ISW. December 2018.</li>
  <li> <b>Math 599</b>, a graduate course on teaching mathematics at the undergraduate level. Winter 2018 Term 2.</li>
</ol>
  <!-- Maddie is an awesome teacher. I know this because she has done all the things that UBC has for instructor development, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>  Math 599, a course on teaching mathematics at the undergraduate level. </li>
  <li> Instructional Skills Workshop, a workshop for improving your instructional skills. </li>
  <li> Facilitator Development Workshop, a workshop for learning how to facilitate an Instructional Skills Workshop. </li>
  <li> Clickers Workshop, a workshop for learning how to effectively use iClickers in class. </li>
  <li> an education theory (?) seminar/thing with Matt, unsure of the details of this one, but I'm like 95% sure it happened. </li>
</ol> -->
