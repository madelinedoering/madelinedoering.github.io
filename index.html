<h3 id="bio">Bio</h3>

<p>I am a PhD student in Mathematics at The University of British Columbia working with <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/" target="_blank">Brian Marcus</a>. Previously, I worked with <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~rpavlov/" target="_blank">Ronnie Pavlov</a> at the University of Denver. I study symbolic dynamics, a sub-genre of dynamical systems. I enjoy teaching mathematics and working with others on developing instructional skills. When I’m not thinking about math or teaching, I’m reading, baking, looking for whales, or sampling new cheeses.
</p>
  <!-- Maddie is the coolest cat in the Math department. She's doing her PhD in symbolic dynamics at The University of British Columbia, working with <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/" target="_blank">Brian Marcus</a>. Previously, she worked with <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~rpavlov/" target="_blank">Ronnie Pavlov</a> at the University of Denver, who is very good at trivia and probably also math. -->

  I have studied shifts of finite type (SFTs), specifically the sets of periodic points. I also participate in the Dynamical Systems seminar where we have discussed ergodic theory, entropy, and multidimensional shift spaces.
  <!-- Maddie does lots of great things that I know very little about except that it is contained within the complement of what I do in dynamical systems. Also there is some graph theory. She presents regularly in a seminar on [ergodic theory?], because she is awesome.-->

During my Master's degree in Business Analytics, I worked with <a href="https://www.amprobotics.com" target="_blank">AMP Robotics</a> to complete my capstone project for which I won the Distinguished Capstone Award. This work looked at using system data to predict machine malfunctions in their recycling robot, as well as potential data monetization.</p>
<p>
During my undergraduate degree, I wrote honors theses in symbolic dynamics (mathematics) and microfinance (economics). My mathematics thesis was the basis for the "A characterization of the sets of periods within shifts of finite type" with Ronnie Pavlov. My economics thesis, "Microfinance in Ecuador - A Review," was completed onsite with a summer research grant. This work was presented at the <a href="https://www.du.edu/uap/symposium/" target="_blank">2016 DU Undergraduate Research Symposium</a> .
</p>
  <!-- During her Master's degree, Maddie did even more amazing things. More than I can possibly fathom. </p>
  <p> This work was presented at: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/" target="_blank"> The aforementioned [ergodic theory] seminar, 2018 </a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/wse/river_symposiums/2016/index.html" target="_blank"> probably another time too, idk </a> </li>
</ol>
<p> The abstract for this thesis can be found <a href="https://digitalcommons.bucknell.edu/honors_theses/405/" target="_blank">here</a>. I think there is already a paper. </p>

<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
<p> 
I greatly enjoy teaching mathematics and developing new instructional skills. I've completed several professional development opportunities, including but not limited to: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Instructional Skills Workshop</b>, a comprehensive instructor development workshop designed to enhance the teaching effectiveness of both new and experienced instructors. May 2018. </li>
  <li> <b>Facilitator Development Workshop</b>, a workshop designed to train facilitators for the ISW so more locations/departments can have their own ISW. December 2018.</li>
  <li> <b>Math 599</b>, a graduate course on teaching mathematics at the undergraduate level. Winter 2018 Term 2.</li>
</ol>
  <!-- Maddie is an awesome teacher. I know this because she has done all the things that UBC has for instructor development, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>  Math 599, a course on teaching mathematics at the undergraduate level. </li>
  <li> Instructional Skills Workshop, a workshop for improving your instructional skills. </li>
  <li> Facilitator Development Workshop, a workshop for learning how to facilitate an Instructional Skills Workshop. </li>
  <li> Clickers Workshop, a workshop for learning how to effectively use iClickers in class. </li>
  <li> an education theory (?) seminar/thing with Matt, unsure of the details of this one, but I'm like 95% sure it happened. </li>
</ol> -->
